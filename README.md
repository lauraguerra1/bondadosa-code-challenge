# Abstract: 
This is a virtual grocery store that fetches information from the Edamam Food Database API. This web app allows users to search for products, add them to their cart, and purchase the items! The app uses search params so that users can easily share their search with others. Users are able to change the quantity of a certain item in their cart, or remove it altogether. To account for users being able to view a confirmation of their orders even after navigating away from the site, previously placed orders are saved in localStorage. This behavior is built to mimic a database, which is not implemented in this application. The app was built with React and JavaScript, using React Router for routing and Prop Types for a better development experience. Future ideas for continuing to expand on this application include adding a database to replace localStorage, saving the users current cart in session storage, and allowing users to filter products by their nutritional content.
